# AI-Interview-Assistant

An AI-driven interview platform that allows interviewers to create sessions and share unique links with candidates. Candidates can upload resumes, get AI-generated personalized interview questions, answer them in real time with timers, and finally receive automated AI evaluation (score + summary). Interviewers can then view candidate responses and results in their dashboard.
